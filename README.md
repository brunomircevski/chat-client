# Decentralized encrypted chat application - WIP
This app is a electron client for [chat-server](https://github.com/brunomircevski/chat-server) api

The goal of this project is to create a multiplatform desktop application that communicates with multiple servers to send and receive encrypted messages between users. Everyone can set up their own server instance and communicate with others using the same or different server. Messages are encrypted on client devices. No data about user's contacts is send to the server.
